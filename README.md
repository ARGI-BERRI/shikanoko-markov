# shikanoko-markov

Inspired by [【マルコフ連鎖】Shikanoko but it's a Markov chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkq13ZthmA0).

## Prepare and execute

```shell
poetry install
poetry run python run_multi.py  # runs 10000 times, so it's very heavy
poetry run python run_single.py # runs only 1 time, it's fun
```
